Webex Lab:

This lab provides you with access to a real Webex system as a member of the http://apidemoeu.webex.com demonstration site. Using this user interface, you can provision yourself a user account in this site. You can then use that account to schedule, start and test Webex online meeting functionality. If youâ€™re a developer, know that you can use the same account to explore the Webex APIs to integrate Webex into your applications.
